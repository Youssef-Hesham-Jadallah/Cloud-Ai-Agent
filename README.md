# 🎓 Advanced AI Research Trends in MENA Universities
### Enhanced Multi-Agent Analysis System

An advanced **multi-agent analytical system** designed to explore, analyze, and visualize **AI research trends across leading MENA universities**.  
The system leverages **Python, Streamlit, Pandas, and Plotly** to simulate large-scale academic datasets and generate strategic insights using collaborative AI agents.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project simulates a **real-world AI research analytics platform** that:
- Analyzes publication trends across MENA universities
- Identifies emerging AI research topics
- Ranks universities based on research impact
- Generates strategic research and collaboration recommendations
- Produces interactive dashboards and comprehensive reports

The system follows a **Multi-Agent Architecture**, where each agent is responsible for a specialized task in the research analysis pipeline.

## 🤖 System Architecture (Multi-Agent Design)

The platform is composed of **five intelligent agents**:

| Agent | Role |
|------|------|
| 🔍 **Search Agent** | Filters research papers based on university, topic, year, and citations |
| 📊 **Analysis Agent** | Computes advanced statistics (citations, h-index contribution, rankings) |
| 📈 **Trend Analysis Agent** | Detects growth trends and identifies hot & emerging topics |
| 💡 **Recommendation Agent** | Generates strategic research & collaboration recommendations |
| 📝 **Reporting Agent** | Creates visualizations and generates a full analytical report |

Each agent operates independently while contributing to a unified analytical workflow.
